# FtoCDT
C/C++ projects which are friendly to Eclipse CDT.

All C/C++ sub projects in this project are friendly to eclipse CDT, no need to manage the complicated compiling framework and makefiles, just let CDT do every trivial things for you! 

A C/C++ project is friendly to Eclipse CDT, that means you can just open the soruce code into Eclipse as Makefile Project with Existing Code, select Generate Makefiles Automatically, then you can compile and debug it without writing a single makefile.

With this attribute, a C/C++ fan can easily debug and reasearch a complicated open soure software in Eclipse.

In this project, I upload Qemu4.20 as an example.

The changed Qemu4.20 can be debugged and modified easily in Eclipse IDE which make you more convenient to watch every variable with complicated data structure and understand the start process.
